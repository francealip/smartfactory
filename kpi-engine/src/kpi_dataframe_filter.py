        Parameters:
        df (DataFrame): The input dataframe containing data with a 'time' column.
        start_period (str): The start of the time period, formatted as a string.
        end_period (str): The end of the time period, formatted as a string.

        DataFrame: A filtered dataframe containing only rows where the 'time' column

        Applies a series of filtering operations to the input dataframe based on KPI, 
        machine ID, machine type, and time period.

        Parameters:
        kpi (str): The name of the KPI to filter by.
        df (DataFrame): The input dataframe containing the data to be filtered.
        machine_id (str): The identifier of the machine for filtering; can be specific or 
                        'all_machines' to include all machines.
        machine_type (str): The type of machine for filtering; can be specific or 'any' for all types.
        start_period (str): The start of the time period for filtering, formatted as a string.
        end_period (str): The end of the time period for filtering, formatted as a string.

        Returns:
        DataFrame: A dataframe filtered sequentially by:
                - Machine ID
                - Machine type
                - KPI
                - Time period (inclusive of start and end)
        
        Notes:
        - This method orchestrates calls to other filtering methods in the 
        `kpi_dataframe_filter` module, chaining their results to progressively refine 
        the dataset.
        - If no filters are applied (e.g., 'all_machines' and 'any' are passed, and no KPI or time filters 
        are specified), the original dataframe is returned.

        Example:
        The method performs the following operations in sequence:
        1. Filters by machine ID using `filter_dataframe_by_machine`.
        2. Filters by machine type using `filter_dataframe_by_typology`.
        3. Filters by KPI using `filter_dataframe_by_kpi`.
        4. Filters by time period using `filter_dataframe_by_time`.
