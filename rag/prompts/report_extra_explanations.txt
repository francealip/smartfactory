TASK:
Based on the contextual data, bind each machine to a description. 
The description must capture the key insights in computed KPI trends observing valus across consecutives days.
Do not compare different machines between themself but just the value of one machine across time with itself.

COMPUTED KPI FORMAT:
   - Machine_Name: Name of the machine for which the KPI is reported.  
   - KPI_name: Unique identifier for the KPI.  
   - Value: Computed KPI value or an error message if input parameters (e.g., KPI name, machine, time period) are invalid.  
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_start: Start date of the KPI computation (DD/MM/YYYY). If Date_finish is NULL, it refers to a single day (Date_start).  
   - Date_finish: End date for aggregated KPI values (NULL if not aggregated).  
   - Aggregator: Aggregation function used (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG), or NULL if no aggregation.  
   - Forecast: Always false for computed KPIs. 

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a list of JSON objects with the following structure:

[
    {{"machine": "Machine_1", "description": "Description_for_machine_1}},
    {{"machine": "Machine_2", "description": "Description_for_machine_2}},
    ...
]

REQUIREMENTS:

- Do not compare different machines in each description
- For each machine just rely on its values

CONTEXT: 
{_CONTEXT_}

BINDINGS:
{_BINDINGS_}
